Super Jewel Quest
v0.0.44

This game is a color-puzzle game made originally for Samsung phones.
It came pre-installed as a non-removable game for some of their dumb phones, to have something to pass the time.

I do not own the game or source, and Samsung would not be so happy if they found about about this.
But honestly it's a decent game and they discontinue anything older than 5 years, so I guess it doesn't matter.

I still don't know how the OS is named, no one does. But it's probably something based on Java considering the fact that the game itself is a .jar file.

Enjoy!
